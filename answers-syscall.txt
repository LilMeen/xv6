5. Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
Answer: a load page fault (code 13), address 0 didn't mapped in the kernel address space. It is confirmed by the value in scause above.
